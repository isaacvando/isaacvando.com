        Every engineering organization is locked in an unresolvable conflict with its mortal enemy: The Business. The engineering organization tries its best to carry out its noble quest to Make The Code Good in spite of the spirited attempts of The Business to direct it towards profit instead. Despite their strongest efforts, neither combatant can disentangle themself from their foe, caught in a twisted symbiotic relationship until death.

        Of course that's ridiculous! But it really seems to be the way some people think. Engineering is just a cost center, and The Business is just a distraction from the engineering. I've often heard engineers talk about "the business side" as if it's something they are not a part of. "This requirement is coming from the business side." "I'd like to do some refactoring, but the business side won't approve the project."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is wrong and actively harmful to everyone involved. Talking about "the business side" implies that there's some other, different side of things where the engineers reside. In reality, there's only a business. Everyone employed by that business
        <em>should</em>
        be working towards the same goals together. Engineers, sales people, account managers, customer support, legal, product: we're all on the same team.
      </p>

        I want engineers to be more business-minded. We are usually quite bad at this as a profession. Engineers seem to very frequently forget what their salaries are when choosing what to spend their time on. I encourage you to figure out how much one day of your time costs your employer (make sure to include benefits!) and keep that in mind when you decide what to spend your time on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want engineers to be more involved with product decisions. It's hard to spend your time more efficiently if you don't have any say over how you spend it! When you're closer to the decision making and the real operation of a business, you can't help but become more business-minded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Involving engineers in the business naturally calms the tension between "the business side" and engineering too. It's much easier to trust an engineer that some large-scale refactoring genuinely is worth spending time on when they already have a track record of making financially responsible decisions.
